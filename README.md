# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a game I developed for a class through Udacity.

It asks the human player to chose a level of difficulty, and then has different strategies it uses based on that.

It could repeat the same position (Rock, Paper, Scissors), it could rotate through the options, it could chose a random 
play, or it mirror the human players move
